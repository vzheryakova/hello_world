trying to make sense of github
today is a weird day, everything seems to resist my plans. But at least I'm trying new stuff and trying to make sense out of different unknown - to me - areas. all this year started weird and goes just like this day, with some resistance to my plans and dreams. but I am hanging in there anyways, will see what comes next.
